  content="<p>The wireframes were created in Sketch and then shared in InVision, to gather comments and further iterate each board.<br />I decided to use a monochrome style (one colour against white) to obtain a straightforward form of wireframing that matches its function. You can read more about it on the UX Movement website at this link: <a href='https://uxmovement.com/wireframes/why-the-best-wireframe-style-is-no-style/' target='_blank' title='UX Movement: “Why the Best Wireframe Style Is No Style'>“Why the Best Wireframe Style Is No Style.”</a></p>
  <p> The process continued “wireframing in the browser”, outlining the website's structure, content and features, with actual code and live dynamic data. Then progressively starting to add semantics, ARIA rules and schema metadata relevant to search engines and assistive devices. A crucial step to ensure compliance with content discovery, consumption and syndication's web services.</p>"
