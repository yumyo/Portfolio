profile: il manifesto is an Italian national daily newspaper founded in 1969 by a collective of radical, left-wing and communist journalists. It is a publishing cooperative of journalists and workers established “in the belief that the collective ownership of a newspaper and its self-management on the part of those who produce it are essential to ensure the independence and autonomy of information from economic interests and political power”. While it still calls itself “communist” in the name, il manifesto is not connected to any political party nor organization.
