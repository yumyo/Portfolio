My collaboration with Raconteur started with moving Raconteur's main website away from any external provider. The long term vision was to begin offering digital products to their clients alongside their traditional printed products lineup. 

My work started by identifying three main areas or critical aspects of raconteur.net to be placed at the bottom of the redesign. These three key aspects were Content, Design, and Technology.

We explored issues, possible solutions, and general considerations on the related topics for each aspect:

Content
Content structure analysis. Definition of a new information architecture.
Current Issues
Chaotic content presentation
No clear user journey
Blurred storyline to follow
Proposals
Organise the content into meaningful containers 
Leverage the full power of storytelling
Define individual goals/audience for each group
Keywords: Information Architecture, Storytelling
Design
One of the striking aspects of Raconteur and a cornerstone to their success is the incredibly talented design team. 
It appeared immediately clear to me the imperative need to channel the value of the design found in the printed products lineup, helping build a shared vocabulary for consistency, engagement and effectiveness.

Keyword: Design Systems
Current Issues
Undifferentiated content (every page looks the same regardless of any editorial or structural difference)
Proposals
Reflect the visual style of the related digital or printed product
Account for subtle variation according to audience/objectives
Build Design System, a living library of Raconteur styles & patterns
Technology
Keyword: Mobile First

Current Issues
Website poorly optimised
Low page speed scoring
Broken mobile experience
Proposals
Rebuild for high performance and mobile-first
Progressively enhance the experience for desktop and modern browsers


A Reader Oriented IA
I used Google Analytics to identify the best performing content, common entrance and exit pages and, recurring patterns in the user navigation flow. 
Comparing the evidence with the current data structure on the website, we saw the opportunity to organise the content around the main categories or topics, shifting the pivot from "products" to "content" to develop a structure around our reader's interests.
We later merged our findings with an Extensive Competitive analysis to gather further valuable insights on content and features and better understand Raconteur's unique selling proposition. 
Wireframing 
The wireframes were created in Sketch and then shared in InVision, to gather comments and further iterate each board.

I designed the wireframes with a monochrome style (one colour against white) to obtain the most straightforward form of wireframing that matches its function. 
You can read more about it on the UX Movement website at this link: "Why the Best Wireframe Style Is No Style"

From static wireframes to wireframing in the browser 
When the static wireframes reached maturity, I moved to "wireframing in the browser" to continue the process of outlining the website's structure, content and features, with actual code and live dynamic data.
At this stage, I started adding semantics, ARIA rules and schema metadata relevant to search engines and assistive devices. 
It is crucial to ensure the data structure follows the semantic hierarchy outlined by the HTML5 spec and the Readability Article Publishing Guidelines for maximum compatibility with any web service that revolves around content discovery, consumption and syndication.
Top Tier Hosting
Opting for an infrastructure based on Docker containers to gain:
Continuous Deployment and Testing
Multi-Cloud Platforms
Environment Standardisation and Version Control
Isolation and Security
Also ensuring:
Virtually unlimited scalability. 
Reliability. 
Best value for money. 

Main Navigation and Topics colours
We started slicing the spectrum into eight main hues to differentiate the main topics with distinctive colours. Then each hue has been associated with a topic, loosely following some basic principles of colour psychology common to our European/Western heritage:

Purple = Current Affairs
Red/Pink = Business
Orange = Finance
Yellow = Technology
Green = Healthcare
Teal = Sustainability
Deep Sky Blue = Culture
Dark Blue = Lifestyle

The last colour iteration aimed to address visual imparities, with rich tonal variations and correction for UI design.

The Custom Publishing section would have been developed as a stand-alone website to support the division's specific needs and objectives.
