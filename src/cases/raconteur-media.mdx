This process led to deciding to shift the pivot from 'products' to 'content' to develop a structure around our reader's interests.<br /><br />We then merged our findings with an Extensive Competitive analysis to gather valuable insights on content and features and better understand Raconteur's unique selling proposition.</p>"

<ProjectDetail
  label=""
  content="<p> The next step was moving to “wireframing in the browser” to continue the process of outlining the website's structure, content and features, with actual code and live dynamic data. At this stage, I started adding semantics, ARIA rules and schema metadata relevant to search engines and assistive devices. These steps are crucial to ensure compliance with content discovery, consumption and syndication's web services.</p>"

  Slicing the spectrum into eight hues to differentiate the primary topics with distinctive colours, loosely following some basic principles of colour psychology common to our European/Western heritage:
  The last colour iteration aimed to address visual imparities, with rich tonal variations and correction for UI design.
