  <br />
  <br />
  <p>Content</p>
  <br /><ul><li>Analyse the content structure and define a new information architecture.</li><li>Leverage the power of storytelling.</li><li>Define clear goals for each significant target group.</li></ul>
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>Design</p>
  <br />
  <ul><li>Channel the value of the design found in the printed products lineup</li><li>Account for subtle variation according to audience/objectives</li><li>Build Design System, to act asd shared vocabulary and living library of Raconteur styles &amp; patterns</li></ul>
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>Technology</p>
  <br />
  <ul><li>Rebuild for high performance and mobile-first</li><li>Progressively enhance the experience for desktop and modern browsers</li><li>Move to a cloud infrastructure and define an efficient DevOps workflow</li></ul>"

This process led to deciding to shift the pivot from 'products' to 'content' to develop a structure around our reader's interests.<br /><br />We then merged our findings with an Extensive Competitive analysis to gather valuable insights on content and features and better understand Raconteur's unique selling proposition.s</p>"

### Hosting and Dev Ops

We kept using WordPress to reduce the complexity of this redesing iteration but switchig from a conventional hosting provider to the [Pantheon](https://pantheon.io/) infrastructure based on Docker containers to gain:


- Local and Remote Environment Standardisation and Version Control
- Continuous Deployment and Testing
- Isolation and Security
- Virtually unlimited scalability

<ProjectDetail
  label="Wireframings"
  content="<p>The wireframes were created in Sketch and then shared in InVision, to gather comments and further iterate each board.<br />I decided to use a monochrome style (one colour against white) to obtain a straightforward form of wireframing that matches its function. You can read more about it on the UX Movement website at this link: <a href='https://uxmovement.com/wireframes/why-the-best-wireframe-style-is-no-style/' target='_blank' title='UX Movement: “Why the Best Wireframe Style Is No Style'>“Why the Best Wireframe Style Is No Style.”</a></p>
  <p> The process continued “wireframing in the browser”, outlining the website's structure, content and features, with actual code and live dynamic data. Then progressively starting to add semantics, ARIA rules and schema metadata relevant to search engines and assistive devices. A crucial step to ensure compliance with content discovery, consumption and syndication's web services.</p>"
